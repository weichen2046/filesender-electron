# Filesender

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.24. We use a fork [angular-cli][fork-angular-cli] which support `webpackTarget` to build electron app.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.
